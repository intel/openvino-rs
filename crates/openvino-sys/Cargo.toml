    # Since it is quite difficult to fit OpenVINO into the 10MB crate limit, this crate is published with only the
    # sources necessary for bindgen to build the Rust bindings. This means that the crate can only be either:
    # - built from OpenVINO sources when built as the primary crate (unlikely usage)
    # - built from an OpenVINO installation when used as a dependency
